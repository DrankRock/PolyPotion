# PROGRESS.md — Frontier Audit implementation tracker

Companion to `Frontier Audit.dc.html` (Chapter II). **This file is the source
of truth for what's shipped vs. pending.** If you (a future Claude or human)
implement a finding: update the checkbox here, add a line to the log, flip the
`done: true` flag on the finding in the audit's logic class, and pick the next
five in "UP NEXT". Chapter I (`Audit.dc.html`) is fully done — don't reopen it.

## How things are wired (read before implementing)

- Tools are `*.dc.html` files (custom DC runtime via `studio3D_scripts/support.js` —
  older than the current spec, deliberately kept) + a lazy-imported engine in
  `studio3D_scripts/*-engine.js`.
- The shell `index.html` registers each tool 5×: pane div, TOOLDEFS (command
  palette), FRAMES (iframe src), CHAR_TOOLS (receives active character), the
  postMessage wiring list, plus a dock item. Grep for `retarget` to see all spots.
- Active character travels as GLB over postMessage (`studio:loadCharUrl` /
  `studio:loadCharBuffer`).
- `sw.js`: add new files to PRECACHE and **bump CACHE_VERSION**.
- Shared humanoid logic lives in `studio3D_scripts/bone-map.js` (slots,
  dictionaries, auto-detect, VRM validation) — reuse it, don't fork it.

## DONE (shipped July 2026)

- [x] **Animation retargeting** — new Retarget tool (`Retarget.dc.html` +
      `retarget-engine.js`). Auto bone-map (Mixamo/UE5/Rigify/VRM + fuzzy),
      SkeletonUtils.retargetClip, hip-height root scaling, side-by-side sync
      preview, GLB export. Registered in dock/palette/frames/sw.
- [x] **ARKit 52 blendshapes** — `MorphEngine.addARKitSet()` in
      `morph-engine.js` + "⚗ ARKit 52 set" button in `Morph.dc.html`. Creates
      all 52 named targets at 0, seeds 6 big shapes via region heuristics +
      side masking.
- [x] **Landmark-guided ARKit ("Guided ARKit…")** — user clicks 5 points
      (chin, mouth corner, nose, eye, brow); `_generateARKitFromLandmarks()`
      synthesizes all 52 shapes anchored to them (gaussian regions scaled by
      eye distance, jaw as real rotation about an inferred hinge, auto side
      masking). Never overwrites shapes the user already sculpted. Flow:
      `startLandmarks()` → clicks land in the pointerdown handler →
      `onLandmarksDone` callback; prompt banner in `Morph.dc.html`.
- [x] **VRM 1.0 export** — `vrm-export.js` (GLB JSON-chunk surgery: VRMC_vrm
      humanoid + expressions mapped from ARKit morph names + meta/lookAt).
      Wired as a `vrm` format in `exporter.js` FORMATS. Validates required
      bones, reports missing.
- [x] **ORM pack + normal convention** — `BMEngine.packORM()` and
      `setNormalConvention('opengl'|'directx')` in `bakemaps-engine.js`
      (green-channel flip applied at bake time); "Game-ready" panel in
      `BakeMaps.dc.html` with convention segmented control + rough/metal
      sliders; ORM appears in map previews.
- [x] **WebXR view-in-your-room** — `xrSupport()` / `startXR(mode)` in
      `showcase-engine.js` (AR hit-test reticle + tap-to-place at 1:1,
      VR fallback, stage strip/restore on session end); button in
      `Showcase.dc.html`; iframe `allow` gained `xr-spatial-tracking`.

## UP NEXT (the second brew — five recommendations)

- [x] **1. Skeleton presets & bone-name maps on export** — `SKELETON_TARGETS`
      + `renameSkeleton()` in `exporter.js` (renames bones AND animation track
      bindings via `bone-map.js#renameForTarget`); "Bone naming" chip row in
      the Export dialog (hidden for geometry-only formats and VRM, which
      renames itself). Export toast reports renamed count.
- [x] **2. LOD chain generation** — `DEEngine.makeLODs(ratios)` in
      `decimate-engine.js`: decimates the ORIGINAL at 100/60/30/12%, packs one
      GLB with meshes named `<name>_LOD0..3` (Unity LOD Group / Unreal
      convention). "▣ Make LODs (.glb)" button in `Decimate.dc.html`.
- [x] **3. Expression & emotion library** — expression store in
      `morph-engine.js` (`loadExpressions` / `saveExpression` /
      `deleteExpression` / `applyExpression` / `captureExpression`),
      localStorage key **`pp-expressions`** (shared contract — Lipsync/Pose
      should read the same key), 10 starter presets (blink, 4 emotions,
      4 visemes, neutral). Chip board at the top of Morph's right panel:
      click applies, right-click deletes saved ones, ⊕ Save captures the
      current slider mix.
- [x] **4. Unit & scale validator** — `validateScale()` + `checkGLB()` in
      `exporter.js` (bbox height vs human range, mm/cm/×100 detection with
      suggested fix multiplier, non-uniform scale warning); pre-flight panel
      in the Export dialog with a one-click "Fix: scale ×N" button.
- [x] **5. Character passport** — `passport-export.js`: one self-contained
      .html (embedded base64 GLB + a hand-written zero-dependency WebGL viewer
      — no CDN three.js, so it truly opens offline anywhere — + stats grid +
      credits/licence footer). The ⤓ button inside re-downloads the embedded
      GLB, so the passport doubles as the asset carrier. Wired as a `passport`
      format in the Export dialog (author input + licence chips appear for it;
      scale slider/validator fix honoured via re-pack, always Y-up). Stats
      (tris/verts/bones/morphs/materials/anims/size) come from the GLB JSON
      chunk; height is measured live by the viewer. Deviation from the plan:
      lives in Export (the one exit door), not Showcase.

## UP NEXT (the third brew — five recommendations)

- [ ] **1. glTF material extensions + Draco/meshopt export toggles** (M)
- [ ] **2. Texture atlas + material merge** (M) — draw-call reducer
- [x] **3. Webcam face capture → ARKit shapes** — `face-capture.js` wraps
      MediaPipe Tasks-Vision FaceLandmarker (CDN, cached by the sw runtime
      cache; camera processed fully on-device). Its blendshape names are the
      ARKit 52, so scores stream straight into `applyExpression()`. ◉ Capture
      button + mirrored preview in Morph's right panel; requires the ARKit set
      first; stop = freeze → ⊕ Save as expression. Panel re-renders throttled
      while live. Follow-up: record takes to an animation clip.
- [x] **4. Pose mirror + pose library** — mirror already existed in Pose;
      added the saved-pose shelf: `capturePose()`/`applyPoseData()` in
      `pose-engine.js` (canon-key → local quaternion snapshots), localStorage
      **`pp-poses`** (shared contract), shelf UI in `Pose.dc.html` (click
      apply / right-click delete / ⊕ Save), and the local Text-to-pose matcher
      checks saved names first.
- [ ] **5. In-viewport IK handles in Pose** (L)

## REMAINING (backlog, from the audit — pick into UP NEXT as slots free up)

- [ ] Vertex Animation Textures (VAT) bake
- [ ] Colour-management contract (linear working space, sRGB/data tagging, view transform)
- [ ] Symmetry as a shared contract (one symmetry map for all brush tools)
- [ ] Multi-character scene assembly (stage)
- [ ] Local-network live co-op (WebRTC)
